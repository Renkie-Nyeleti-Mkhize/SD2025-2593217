I had to initialise a Git repository and ensure it was properly set up 
Secondly I had to create three files,  the first was "student-info.txt" which contained my details, followed by the "index.html" file that contained a "hello world" text. Lastly , I created another file named "report.md", which contains a brief report of everything I did. 
In the end all the files should be deployed into the repository that I had created.
